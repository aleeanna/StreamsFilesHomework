Early years[edit]
Kurt Vonnegut, Jr., was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, to third-generation German-American parents, Edith (Lieber) Vonnegut and Kurt Vonnegut, Sr..[6] Both his
 father and his grandfather Bernard Vonnegut attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and were architects in the Indianapolis firm of Vonnegut & Bohn.
 His great-grandfather, Clemens Vonnegut, Sr., was the founder of the Vonnegut Hardware Company, an Indianapolis firm.[7] Vonnegut had an older brother, Bernard 
 and a sister, Alice.[8] Bernard, later an atmospheric scientist at the University at Albany, discovered that silver iodide could be used for cloud seeding, the 
 process of artificially stimulating precipitation.[9]
Vonnegut graduated from Shortridge High School in Indianapolis in May 1940 and went to Cornell University later that year. He majored in chemistry, and was
 assistant managing editor and associate editor of The Cornell Daily Sun.[10] He was a member of the Delta Upsilon Fraternity, as was his father.

While at Cornell, Vonnegut enlisted in the United States Army during World War II.[11] The Army transferred him to the Carnegie Institute of Technology, and
 later to the University of Tennessee to study mechanical engineering.[1] On Mother's Day 1944, while he was visiting his parents during a three-day trip, he
 woke up to find that his mother had committed suicide with sleeping pills.[12]
